	<h1>About Quick Groups</h1>
	<p>
		A self-service <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
		interface for grouping <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveDirectory">ActiveDirectory</a>
		names.
	</p>

	<h2>Use cases</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Finding the right people to include on a new e-mail thread</li>
		<li>Dynamic groups for which the utility would be reduced by slow AD admin response times</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Motivation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Group creation does not require AD administrator approval</li>
		<li>Could be used for "drafting" true AD groups
			<ul>
				<li>Add a feature to "submit draft" to AD administrator to
					apply to the authoritative AD?</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Query-able without requiring AD credentials</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Design Goals</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Distributed-maintenance</li>
		<li>Avoids AD administrator turnaround time</li>
		<li>Lighter-weight and less "official" than actual AD groups</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Design rationale</h2>
	<p>I wanted to be able to infer new groups from existing groups.
		There are two opposing approaches for this:
	<ul>
		<li>Make specific groups the basic unit, infer larger groups
			through union operations</li>
		<li>Make general categories (i.e. "tags") the basic unit, infer
			more specific groups through intersection operations</li>
	</ul>
	I've chosen the former approach.
	</p>

	<h2>Limits of Scope</h2>
	<p>This project shall not become standalone "announcement list" or
		"discussion list" software, with the ability to send and store
		messages. Rather, it shall only be a method of obtaining lists of
		people for which to communicate by other means.</p>
	<h2>Features</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Should be able to whitelist who can edit a particular group</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>TODO</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>May also be useful in Jira plugins for automatic field
			population logic</li>
	</ul>
