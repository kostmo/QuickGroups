	<h1>About Quick Groups</h1>
	<p>
		A self-service <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
		interface for grouping <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveDirectory">ActiveDirectory</a>
		names.
	</p>

	<h2>Use cases</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Finding the right people to include on a new e-mail thread
         <ul><li>This use is intended for involving relevant personnel in topical discussions by launching an email client with pre-populated addresses.
            For important discussions whose content should be a matter of public record within an organization (for example, making long-term policy decisions),
            you should use a mailing list service like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Mailman">Mailman</a>.</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
		<li>Skills inventory: broadcasting available skills in an organization</li>
		<li>Dynamic groups that change faster than it would take the AD admin(s) to update them</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Design Goals / Motivation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Distributed-maintenance</li>
		<li>Avoids AD administrator turnaround time</li>
		<li>Lighter-weight and less "official" than actual AD groups</li>
		<li>"Lighter-weight" than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Mailman">GNU Mailman</a> mailing lists</li>
		<li>Group creation does not require AD administrator approval</li>
		<li>Could be used for "drafting" true AD groups
			<ul>
				<li>Add a feature to "submit draft" to AD administrator to apply to the authoritative AD?</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Query-able without requiring AD credentials</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Design choices</h2>
	<p>I wanted to be able to infer new groups from existing groups.
		There are two opposing approaches for this:
	<ul>
		<li>Make specific groups the basic unit, infer larger groups
			through union operations</li>
		<li>Make general categories (i.e. "tags") the basic unit, infer
			more specific groups through intersection operations</li>
	</ul>
	I've chosen the former approach.
	</p>

	<h2>Limits of Scope</h2>
	<p>This project shall not become standalone "announcement list" or
		"discussion list" software, with the ability to send and store
		messages. Rather, it shall only be a method of obtaining lists of
		people for which to communicate by other means.</p>
	<h2>Features</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Should be able to whitelist who can edit a particular group</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>TODO</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>May also be useful in Jira plugins for automatic field population logic</li>
	</ul>
